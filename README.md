## Using Intersection Observer API in React - Hashnode Article

This project was built as part of a technical article I wrote explaining how to use Javascript's Intersection Observer API in React.

The article talks about;

- The benefits and drawbacks of using event listeners for scroll triggered functionalities and animations.
- Why you may not want to use an animation library like GSAP or Framer Motion.
- Detailed explanation about the Intersection Observer API and its properties such as the callback function and the `options` object.
